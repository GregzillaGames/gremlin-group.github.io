With the great advances in the software development area, where systems are becoming larger and more complex, the testing area is suffering to keep up with. In this paper, we describe a formal procedure to perform the synthesis of random programs from preexisting code, considering all the constraints imposed by the Java compiler. We prove that the code produced by our method is well-typed with regard to a simplified type-system for Java. Furthermore, we present an implementation of this procedure using Java and some extra tools. The results of this paper can be used as input for testing libraries and compilers.
